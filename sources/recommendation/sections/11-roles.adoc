== Consideration on Designer and Architect Roles

EDITOR: This section is important but will require a lot of rewording

Designers and architects form a key constituency of this Recommendation.

* They play an important if not existential role in the success of a solution.

* They can too be the limit to this success.

=== Context for the role

==== Designer and architect jobs across domains

In military engineering and way later in civil engineering (as this is a domain
where humans have a long experience) designers and architects have rather well
codified job descriptions with full curricula that are not only licensed but
deliver diploma which not only gives the right to the architect to do his job,
but comes too with responsibilities and liabilities.

If a bridge falls down, both from a legal and an insurance perspective, the
process will inevitably lead to the question of whether or not the architect is
responsible (liable) or not. His/her responsibility may be engaged.

==== Designer and architect jobs in ICT

The ICT industry incrementally recognized the problem and attributed its
solution to architects and designers which were allocated in various types and
companies functions in IT and ICT we observe many differences, at this stage:

* IT and ICT are domains that are much younger by orders of magnitude than civil
engineering

* The role/job of an architect is extremely recent and was mostly hidden in the
wordings 'software engineer', etc.

* The role/job and covers many subtypes:

** Software architect

** System architect

** Solution architect

** Etc.

* For a long time there were no codification and even trainings or certification
for this job until TOGAF arrived in 1995 and yet, even today, like anything, it
has limits

* There are no liabilities attached to any architect. An architect making a
mistake at design level has absolutely no risk even if (lived stories) it could
incur enormous costs and liabilities for the 'customer' and for the 'provider'
of the architecture.

==== Different types of ICT Designer and Architects

Firstly, at product and service level, there are various types of architects
(the list is not meant to be exhaustive)

.Architect and Designer types
[cols="3",options="header"]
|===
| Architect type | Coverage | Organization

| Software Architect
| Covers the architecture of a software that needs to be developed
| Engineering / R&D

| Product Architect
| Covers the end to end architecture of product that needs to be developed
| Engineering / R&D

| Designer
| Covers the full design of a product or groups of products including other
design criteria such as Societal, Technical, Ecological, Environmental,
Political, Human Factor, etc.
| Engineering / R&D

| Security Architect
| Covers the security aspect of a solution and proposes either a security
architecture or a security by design 'design'
| SoC / CISO / etc.

| System Architect
| Covers the design of an entire set of systems (hardware, software, etc.) that
needs to be put in production for a given period of time (usually years or more)
| Field

| Solution Architect
| Covers the end to end solution (hardware, software, professional services,
partners, compliancy, etc.) for a given customer
| Field

| Technical Directors
| Office of the CTO and CTOs do have a view on design in terms of internal
standardisation, design directions, harmonisation, composability and do
participate in the organization transformation, breaking the silos or
contributing to the collaboration and coordination between the silos based on
design approaches
| Office of CTO

==== The nature of the job

The architects and designers have a pivot job in each organization because they
have to produce deliverables that will take into

EDITOR: the first and second bullets should be checked vs above terminology,
e.g. shouldn't we use the term 'concern' in the first bullet

* In one hand, the considerations of definitions, standards, requirements,
limits and constraints

* On the other hand, the whole lifecycle of a product or a service

The diagram below shows this pivot role on the top and on the bottom shows a
number of dimensions that make the characteristics of the architect in his core
and deepest nature.

EDITOR: Harmonise the cycle with the cycle proposed in section 9.4

As well it is important that each architect / designer, will come with his own
approach which will likely be unique in itself. The architect / designer, could
consider his/her deliverables vs the four below dimensions:

* Anthropology

* Ethics

* Law

* Technology

In special conditions though, especially when no human being had any previous
experience, one needs to consider the reverse order:

* Technology

* Law

* Ethics

* Anthropology
